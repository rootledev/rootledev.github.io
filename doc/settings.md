# Settings reference

Every rootle setting: key, acceptable values, meaning, default. Config
lives at `~/.config/rootle/config.toml` (`$ROOTLE_CONFIG` does not apply —
use `rootle --config PATH` for an alternate file). Missing keys fall
back to defaults; a malformed file never blocks startup (defaults are
used silently). The `:settings` popup edits these in place and writes the same file —
hot-reloads the theme on save. Sections live in a sidebar (Tab/h/l);
themes and the provider kind are radio lists, booleans are ●/○ dots,
and text fields edit in place — ␣/enter activates the row. Committing
a theme recolors the popup immediately. Provider changes save too but
apply after restart.

```toml
[editor]
program = "hx"          # string, optional
args = []               # list of strings
read_only = true        # boolean

[theme]
name = "catppuccin-mocha"   # string
# path = "/abs/or/~/theme.toml"   # string, optional — overrides name

[cache]
max_mb = 512            # integer

[provider]
kind = "github"         # "github" | "stdio"
command = []            # list of strings (kind = "stdio")
timeout_ms = 30000      # per-request read deadline (kind = "stdio")
# stderr = "inherit"    # pass child stderr through (kind = "stdio")
```

## `[editor]` — opening files

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `program` | string, optional | unset | Editor binary. Unset → `$VISUAL` → `$EDITOR` → first of `hx`, `nvim`, `vim`, `vi` on PATH. |
| `args` | list of strings | `[]` | Extra arguments inserted before the file path. |
| `read_only` | boolean | `true` | With `true`, the vim family (`vim`, `nvim`, `vi`, `view`) opens with `-R`. Editors without a read-only flag (e.g. helix) edit the cache copy — rootle never writes back either way. |

Files open from `~/.cache/rootle/edit/<owner>__<repo>/<path>`; rootle
suspends the terminal while the editor runs and fully redraws on
return.

## `[theme]` — colors

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | `"catppuccin-mocha"` | Palette to load. Embedded dark: `catppuccin-mocha`, `dracula`, `gruvbox-dark`, `nord`, `one-dark`, `solarized-dark`, `tokyo-night`. Embedded light: `catppuccin-latte`, `github-light`, `one-light`, `solarized-light`. Unknown name → Catppuccin Mocha. |
| `path` | string, optional | unset | Explicit palette file; wins over `name`. |

`--theme NAME` (CLI) overrides `name` for one session. To write your
own palette — file format, overridable roles, worked example — see
[themes.md](themes.md).

Syntax highlighting maps syntect scopes onto the active palette — a
palette change recolors previews automatically.

## `[cache]` — content store

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_mb` | integer | `512` | Blob cache cap in MiB. Least-recently-used blobs are evicted past it at startup; orphaned trees/blobs are swept. |

Blobs/trees are content-addressed and immutable (never invalidated,
only evicted); repo refs revalidate via ETag (a `304` is free).
The GitHub provider's store lives at
`~/.cache/rootle/providers/github/` (the TUI-level `edit/` scratch stays
at `~/.cache/rootle/`); deleting either is always safe. stdio providers
manage their own caches under `~/.cache/rootle/providers/<name>/`.

## `[provider]` — backend selection

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | `"github"` \| `"stdio"` | `"github"` | `github` = the built-in provider. `stdio` = external child process speaking NDJSON-RPC ([provider-protocol.md](provider-protocol.md)). |
| `command` | list of strings | `[]` | argv for `kind = "stdio"`; element 0 is the executable, the rest its arguments. Ignored for `github`. |
| `timeout_ms` | integer | `30000` | Per-request read deadline for `kind = "stdio"`: a hung backend call fails with a timeout instead of wedging the provider. |
| `stderr` | `"null"` \| `"inherit"` | `"null"` | `inherit` passes the stdio child's stderr through — adapter debugging without a log file. |

Invalid/misfiring stdio configuration falls back to `github` with a
warning in the status line — a provider misconfiguration never blocks
startup. Scaffolding a provider:
[skills/rootle-provider](../skills/rootle-provider/SKILL.md).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ROOTLE_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token (GitHub provider only; `gh auth token` is tried after these). Code search requires a token. |
| `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` | Editor fallbacks when `[editor].program` is unset. |
| `ROOTLE_CLIPBOARD` | Path to a file — yanks (`␣ y`) write there instead of the clipboard (scripts/CI). |
| `ROOTLE_TRACE` | Path to a log file — worker request tracing (debugging). |
| `NO_COLOR` | **Ignored** — a full-screen TUI's colors are semantic, like vim/helix. |

## Command line

```
rootle                    # launch (search popup only on fresh state)
rootle owner/repo         # skip the popup, open a repo
rootle --config PATH      # alternate config file
rootle --theme NAME       # override [theme].name for this session
rootle --version | -V
```

## Where things live

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.config/rootle/config.toml` | configuration |
| `~/.config/rootle/themes/<name>.toml` | palette overrides (`[semantic]` role = hex) |
| `~/.local/state/rootle/state.json` | recents, last org/repo/path, last search scope/extension |
| `~/.cache/rootle/edit/` | files materialized for your editor |
| `~/.cache/rootle/providers/<name>/` | per-provider content cache (safe to delete) |

Cache layout: `trees/<sha>.json` (immutable repo trees), `blobs/<ab>/<rest>`
(blobs sharded by the first two sha chars), `index/refs/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>`
(rev → tree sha + etag, revalidated on open), `edit/` (materialized files).
At startup rootle sweeps orphans and evicts least-recently-used blobs past
`[cache].max_mb` (default 512). Deleting `~/.cache/rootle` is always safe;
state and config are separate files.
